# TextureKitPlayground ü•ê

This project contains my random attempts to get better understanding of [Texture](https://github.com/TextureGroup/Texture). It contains my attempts to replicate their [sample layouts](http://texturegroup.org/docs/automatic-layout-examples-2.html) and my custom layout needs for projects.

## How to Run
1. Get [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), and run `carthage bootstrap --platform iOS`.
2. Open `TextureKitPlayground.xcodeproj` in Xcode 9 or up.
3. Swap the `mainNode` used in `ViewController.swift` with available `Nodes`.
